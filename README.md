# helloWorld


Hi everybody
An interesting thing about this process is that it doesn't always go through the first time, or the examples don't 
necessarily reflect the curret situation. Fortunately I can follow along with others and through
repetition am I able to see and understand what works and what isn't/doesn't work. Also, having watched keystroke errors
I'm now even more aware.
